# Adopting CDEvents and Embracing Interoperability

Talk slides are available in [pdf](cdevents_interoperability.pdf).

## Rebuilding the slides

Install xelatex with most of the plugins via your distro.
Either xelatex or lualatex are required for the fontspec package to work.

Install the IBMPlex font from https://github.com/IBM/plex.

To build the example just run:

```shell
% xelatex cdevents_interoperability.tex
```

the output will be [cdevents_interoperability.pdf](cdevents_interoperability.pdf).
